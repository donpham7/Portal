Your 'bad' cholesterol (LDL) is a little high, which can be improved by making some gentle adjustments to your diet, like eating more healthy fats and fiber, and less fast food. Also, your Vitamin D level is slightly low; increasing your time outdoors and eating Vitamin D-rich foods, or considering a supplement, could help. Continue your active lifestyle and balanced eating, and keep an eye on how your body feels, including your energy, digestion, and mood. We'll check these trends at your next annual visit."
