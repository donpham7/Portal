        "personal_takeaways": "Mr. Tan Ah Kow has several long-term health problems including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and has experienced multiple brain damaging events (strokes). These events have led to serious heart issues, specifically a weakened heart muscle and difficulty pumping blood, as well as chronic kidney disease. The main concern is his severe decline in mental abilities, known as Dementia, which is caused by the strokes and affects his mind and brain functions. Because of this, he struggles with remembering, thinking clearly, and understanding information. He also has difficulty with daily activities such as bathing and using the toilet, and remembering basic personal details like his address or the current date. The medical assessment indicates that his mental abilities are not expected to improve and will likely worsen over time, as there is no current treatment to reverse his Dementia. Due to his significantly impaired mental capacity, he is not able to make his own decisions about his personal care or his finances and possessions."
