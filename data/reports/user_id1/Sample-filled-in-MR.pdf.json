He has conditions like high blood pressure and high cholesterol, which led to multiple brain attacks (strokes) and eventually heart muscle weakness, heart failure, and kidney disease. He has also developed a brain condition called dementia, which is causing severe memory loss and problems with thinking, understanding, and making decisions. This means he needs help with daily activities like personal care and managing his finances, and his thinking abilities are expected to worsen over time.\n\nFor Don Pham, your mild high blood pressure is a condition that, as seen in Mr. Tan's case, requires careful monitoring and management over the long term to prevent more serious health problems like strokes or heart complications later in life. Continuing to manage your health actively, as a healthy athlete, is very important for preventing such progressions."
