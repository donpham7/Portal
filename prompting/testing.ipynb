      "This document is a medical history and physical examination report for Pamela Rogers, a 56-year-old female who presented to the Emergency Department with a week-long history of worsening chest pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient describes the chest pain as dull and aching, originating in the left para-sternal area and radiating to her neck, accompanied by shortness of breath. Initially triggered by exertion (gardening), the pain episodes have increased in frequency and duration, culminating in an episode that awakened her from sleep, prompting her visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her past medical history includes hypertension (diagnosed 3 years prior but medication discontinued) and a total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral oophorectomy. She has a significant family history of premature coronary artery disease (father died at 54 of a heart attack).\n",
      "\n",
      "Physical examination revealed elevated blood pressure (168/98), crackles in both lung bases, a third heart sound (S3), a grade 2/6 systolic decrescendo murmur at the second right intercostal space radiating to the neck, and an abdominal bruit. Other issues noted include epigastric pain, lower back pain, and fibrocystic breast changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary assessment concludes that her chest pain is highly suggestive of **unstable angina pectoris**, given the worsening symptoms and multiple cardiac risk factors (hypertension, early surgical menopause, family history of early ASCVD). Her dyspnea and physical findings (S3, lung crackles) suggest left ventricular dysfunction and possible congestive heart failure secondary to myocardial ischemia. The combination of recent-onset hypertension and an abdominal bruit raises suspicion for **renovascular hypertension**. A **systolic murmur** is also noted, prompting consideration of valvular heart disease like aortic stenosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed plan includes hospital admission to a telemetry unit for close monitoring, initiation of medications such as platelet inhibitors (aspirin), nitrates, and diuretics (for dyspnea and blood pressure control). Further diagnostics include cardiac catheterization and ventriculogram, along with standard lab work. Long-term recommendations include cholesterol monitoring, an exercise program, and a low-fat diet.\n"
